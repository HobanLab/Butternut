Project Description:
This project file contains R Scripts created for a project on <i>Juglans cinerea</i>, also known as butternut. This project is focused on assessing the genetic diversity and structure in butternut with increased sampling of its northern populations as well as assessing the niche of this species. This project is divided into two main folders: genetic_diversity and SDMs.

genetic_diversity: This work uses data from the publication Hoban et al. (2010) and newer sampling efforts on butternut from 2011 - 2015. These individuals were collected by Jeanne Romero-Severson, Sean Hoban, and Martin Williams over the course of near ten years with a major sampling effort closer to 2009 and then followed up by another round of sampling 2012 - 2015. The initial individuals that were collected were genotyped by Sean Hoban and then subsequent individuals were genotyped in the Romero-Severson lab at Notre Dame non-consequetively. The first script labeled "comparison_barplot" was code used to determine if there were scoring differences between researcher. 

SDMs: This folder contains one other subfile - titled "SDMs_worldclim" which has all the steps for the final species distribution model used in this project.
