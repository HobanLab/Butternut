Based on code generated by Peter Breslin and Fabio Suzart de Albuquerque (ASU).

This portion of the project and code was performed to determine what 19 bioclimatic variables best describe the occurrence of butternut using boosted regression trees.

Then, the ecological preferences using WorldClim were projected into the past using Paleoclim variables to generate habitat suitability models for the last 130,000 years before present at different time points. 

This was then used to generate predicted suitable habitat for the 130,000 YBP - now. 


Within this folder, these steps are separated into different scripts. The first is SDM_reduced_spatialautocorrelation, then move to creating pseudoabsence points, then move to variable selection, and finally move to the BRT and prediction maps generation.
