Based on code generated by Peter Breslin and Fabio Suzart de Albuquerque (ASU).

This portion of the project and code was performed to determine what 19 bioclimatic variables best describe the occurrence of butternut using boosted regression trees.

First, occurrence records were downloaded from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio), South East Regional Network of Expertise and Collections (SERNEC), Botanical Information and Ecology Network (BIEN), and the national network of forest survey plots managed by the Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA) of the USDA Forest Service using code generated by Emily Beckman (https://github.com/esbeckman/IMLS_Beckman) but updated for this project in code in the butternut_download_occurrence_record script. 

In the SDMs_worldclim folder the steps for making the model are recorded. First, using the occurrence records generated in the first file, you need to reduced spatial autocorrelation among points (1 point for every sqkm). Then, you need to generate pseudo-absence points to compare presence records too. After that, variable selection is conducted to select the bioclimatic variables most correlated with butternut presence and least correlated with each other. Finally, using these variables and the presence/pseudo-absence points, boosted regressions trees are run to determine suitable habitat for butternut. Then, this model of butternut's requirements was projected into past conditions from Paleoclim (paleoclim.org) 130,000 years ago to present.
