Based on code generated by Peter Breslin and Fabio Suzart de Albuquerque (ASU).

This project was to determine how butternut's ecological preferences in the present day from soil variables and ecological variables. 

Then, the ecological preferences using WorldClim were projected into the past using Paleoclim variables to generate habitat suitability models for the last 22,000 YBP. 

Finally, this was used to generate predicted suitable habitat for the 130,000 YBP - now.
