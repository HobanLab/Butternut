The analyses for genetic diversity were compared to different geographic factors - mean latitude of the population and distance to the edge of the range for each population. "dist_to_edge_figures" stores all the distance to edge figures for genetic diversity and the "latitude_figures" is comparing genetic diversity metrics to the mean latitude of the population.
